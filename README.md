## **Project Introduction**

### *Title: **[Tracking your Carbon Footprint: A Python (Django) Sustainability Application](https://github.com/NeiloErnesto89/carbonprint)** - an carbon footprint tracker website and community*

*ATU DONEGAL - CSD Final Report Project - Django Framework Python Artefact*

This is a site aimed at people interested in being more ecofriendly who want to have a personalised experience and track their own carbon emissions.

*The Figures below show the current home page and the flight tracker section on mobile view*

### *Note for Tester*

*For the **testing purposes**, I suggest (at some stage) logging into the site as the **Admin/SuperUser**, using the following details*: 
- Username: **admin**   
- Password: **XXXXX** - provided in project report*

It's also important to note that an API secret key will need to be generate from the sites: Climatiq and OpenWeatherMap. These keys will need to be added to the **.env** file in the main directory of the **carbonprint** project.

## **Project Introduction**
The purpose of this project is to build a user-friendly web application to help user track and view their carbon footprint. The application will aim to enhance the users experience by providing up-to-date metrics and personalised feedback (via the users inputted information).

## **Requirements**

The following section details the requirements of the project. Functional requirements outline what a system can and cannot achieve, via the users‚Äô actions. 

### *Software Requirements*
This application will be developed using the following software:
- Python 3.10.5
- Django
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git


## **Design**

The Django framework operates with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern whereby, the model (like a class) defines the data structure, the view is the UI being presented to the user and the controller connects them together with programmatic logic.

## **Database**

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, file-based database engine that doesn't require a separate database server to run nor any configuration, and, according to the SQLite official documentation (SQLite, 2023) it is the ‚Äúmost widely deployed database in the world‚Äù. 

### **Database Schema**

## **Implementation**

Steps detailed of the implementation chapter of the project report. Models, Views, URL Routes and Templates and how they function together are all detailed in the report.

## **Testing**

Unit tests and manual tests undertaken to ensure the application is working as expected.
