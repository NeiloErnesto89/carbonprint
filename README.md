## **Project Introduction**
The purpose of this project is to build a user-friendly web application to help user track and view their carbon footprint. The application will aim to enhance the users experience by providing up-to-date metrics and personalised feedback (via the users inputted information).

## **Requirements**

The following section details the requirements of the project. Functional requirements outline what a system can and cannot achieve, via the users‚Äô actions. 

### *Software Requirements*
This application will be developed using the following software:
- Python 3.10.5
- Django
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git


## **Design**

The Django framework operates with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern whereby, the model (like a class) defines the data structure, the view is the UI being presented to the user and the controller connects them together with programmatic logic.

## **Database**

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, file-based database engine that doesn't require a separate database server to run nor any configuration, and, according to the SQLite official documentation (SQLite, 2023) it is the ‚Äúmost widely deployed database in the world‚Äù.
